1) Remove Si4463, add jumper wire from CDCEL913 pin 9 to C32 floating end
2) Remove L6, C30, C13, C19
3) Remove R6, D1
4) Jumper wire from R6's CPU end (PB7) to CDCEL913 pin 11 (Y1). This is for PLL calibration signal.
5) Jumper wire from GPS pin 4 to CPU pin 25 (PB12). This is the 1Hz gate for self calibration.
6) Scrape away the J5 connection between AUDIO (PB1) and R14. Solder DAC_OUT to be connected to R14 instead.
7) Jumper wire CPU pin 15 (PA5) to a 82K resistor. Other end of resistor to intersection of R12/R15.
8) HF-TX signal is on CDCEL913, pin8
9) HF-TX arm signal is on AUDIO (PB1) and can be taken from J5.
10) (optional?) Replace Y2. 25MHz and 26MHz should work great, and maybe even the 24.576 too. Whatever the crystal frequency, set that as PLL_XTAL_NOMINAL_FREQUENCY in Pll.h
